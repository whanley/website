[{"categories":["Computational methods"],"contents":" I am a hater of Wikipedia haters. It drives me up the wall when my kids' history teachers ban them from using it. I use it all the time, even for topics I pretend to have mastered.\nHorsing around with Wikipedia I\u0026rsquo;m writing a book about international law in Cairo. One chapter is a study of a huge probate case (Antun Yusuf \u0026lsquo;Abd al-Messih) that began in 1885. As I was investigating the background of Antun\u0026rsquo;s debtors, I started reading about Ali Pasha Sherif, whose luxury lifestyle was funded by loans of up to £100,000. I remembered Ali Pasha as one of the slaveholding elites described in Eve Troutt Powell\u0026rsquo;s 2003 A Different Shade of Colonialism.\nComputational methods are key to my work on this book. I\u0026rsquo;m trying (so far without great success) to describe the basic producers of the wealth that fueled litigation of the sort that I\u0026rsquo;m examining. To that end, I\u0026rsquo;m working to tie all my datasets into Wikidata, which is the leading linked data hub. Wikidata is fuelled in part by Wikipedia, and I was pleased to see that Ali Pasha has an entry.\nLike many entries about Middle East topics, it\u0026rsquo;s quixotic. Its earliest iteration is a paraphrase of a page from an old AOL site by a California enthusiast of \u0026ldquo;Egyptian Arabian Sport Horses.\u0026rdquo; Not surprisingly, it has more to say about Ali\u0026rsquo;s horses than the man himself. But it said that he was Egypt\u0026rsquo;s foreign minister; of course I immediately thrilled to the idea of international legal precedent established by the personal debts of a colonized foreign secretary.\nTo the credit of my kids\u0026rsquo; history teachers, Wikipedia was wrong: Ali Pasha was never Egypt\u0026rsquo;s minister (though his brother was Ottoman foreign minister). To my credit, Wikipedia is no longer wrong: I corrected the error and tidied up the page. Thanks to the enthusiast who produced the original text, I learned some things about the Egyptian horse market in the 1870s and 80s, and I came better to understand Ali\u0026rsquo;s debts to Antun. And as I tried to figure out who had and had not been Egypt\u0026rsquo;s foreign minister, I discovered another enthusiast: عادل, who has made thousands and thousands and thousands of contributions to Arabic wikipedia, including an incredible set of pages listing Egyptian Ministers, among them a complete page on the foreign ministers.\nListing foreign ministers In a burst of enthusiasm, I got down to work replicating Adil\u0026rsquo;s Arabic ministers list in English. I made it to 1930 before I ran out of steam. I was worn down by a few factors:\n my own desire to move on to the next thing before finishing the task at hand MediaWiki\u0026rsquo;s table syntax, which is a bit intricate to do by hand (I realize now I should just have used a convertor) missing Wikipedia entries for many of the foreign ministers of Egypt (the topic of the rest of this section) a sense that I should fill out this dataset in a more portable format (which is the topic of the rest of this post)  Wikipedia entries on Middle East topics are a treasure trove of resources, especially if you work your way through the \u0026ldquo;Languages\u0026rdquo; links at the bottom of the left hand menu. The foreign ministers list looks very different in English, Arabic, and German. The Persian version is based on the Arabic page before Adil upgraded it, while the Russian version appears to be its own animal. Considering the importance of Egypt to France (and vice versa), it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable that there is no French page.\nAs I worked to mirror the Arabic list in English, I found that several ministers had Arabic pages without English counterparts. I made brief, rough stub pages for\n Wasif Boutros Ghali Ali Zulfikar Pasha Tigrane Pasha Nakhla George al-Motyei Pasha  None of these is great work, but they\u0026rsquo;re enough for others to build out if and when they feel the need.\nAs is often the case, the fine folks who volunteer to keep Wikipedia tidy were cautious to accept thinly referenced new entries. Their position is reasonable enough. At the same time, the effort to expand Wikipedia beyond dead white men sometimes founders on the lack of easily accessible, English-language secondary sources. Wikipedia editors tend to reflexively expect reference to such sources to verify notability. It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough when there\u0026rsquo;s a Times obituary (as there is for Tigrane Pasha). It\u0026rsquo;s more difficult if you build your page entirely on a paragraph in Zirikli\u0026rsquo;s al-A\u0026rsquo;lam, which is what I usually do.\nThings get easier when there\u0026rsquo;s an entry in Arabic wikipedia that you can mirror. Best of all is if the subject is an author who can be found in VIAF: The Virtual International Authority File and WorldCat. Linking to those authority controls usually makes the case for notability clear. In addition, these catalogues provide an easy list of books to add to the Wikipedia entry.\nIt takes a bit of time to make a new page, however, and there were dozens of such pages required to fill out the list of Egypt\u0026rsquo;s foreign ministers. Many of these men were less notable, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel up to doing the digging.\nClosed versus open formats While I was searching up the lesser-known names on the list, I came across another amazing Wikipedia contribution from Adil: in 2016 he created a page for every Egyptian cabinet  from 1878 to the present. Our brilliant friend produced tables listing every minister and ministry. He drew his information from encyclopedic works by Mohammad al-Gawadi, Younan Labib Rizk, and others, and he cites these sources scrupulously.\nWhen I saw these lists, I thought that I could approach this problem differently. Instead of spending a month writing Wikipedia pages, I could spend a few days converting these well-formatted and standardized tables into a format that I could upload to Wikidata.\nWhat is the difference between Wikipedia and Wikidata? Wikipedia is written by and for human readers. While there are automatic bots that crawl through the pages to standardize spelling and dates and categorize pages, almost all of the work is done \u0026ldquo;by hand.\u0026rdquo; Wikidata, on the other hand, is written for and (to a large extent) by automatic readers. It is an elaborately structured dataset based on a fascinating category structure (or ontology) that attempts to describe all existence.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t bore the few readers who have made it this far with rhapsodies about Wikidata. Suffice it to say that this dataset nourishes all sorts of automated reasoning about our world. Those committed to combatting Eurocentrism do well to contribute data to this pool, which tilts very, very white, male, and wealthy. Egyptian ministerial data is not the ideal remedy for that problem. It is an improvement on what\u0026rsquo;s there, however. Even more important, any information that is already digitized, cleaned, and structured is fairly easy to upload. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what I resolved to do.\nThis undertaking is not purely altruistic. I expect to be able to use it to support my own research as well. Wikidata has a query service that uses the powerful SPARQL language. It\u0026rsquo;s fun for trivia: here\u0026rsquo;s a query for the first names of everyone (for whom a first name and birthplace is recorded) who was born in Cairo (press play to get it to run). It can also be fun for more serious questions, so long as the dataset is relatively complete. That\u0026rsquo;s what I set out to do with the ministers.\nDocumenting the process The next part of this post is fairly dry. I\u0026rsquo;m recording details so that others searching for a \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo; can learn from my attempts, and so that I can remember what I did. If you\u0026rsquo;re not interested in the step-by-step, I urge you to jump to the end.\nPreparing the data for OpenRefine   Copy table contents from Arabic foreign ministers pages. It would be possible to automate this, but I did it manually in fifteen minutes.\n  Paste tables into spreadsheet, figure out odd parts (mostly having to do with post-1952, when there were frequent prime minister changes but few minister changes), then paste results into plain text editor as tab separated values. Keep working till you have one line per ministry.\n  Create new table in OpenRefine.\n  Parse dates in OpenRefine until they are standardized. The easiest way to do this is to split the date into several columns (by space). Then\n  Reconcile Prime Minister names with Wikidata. This is easy, because they\u0026rsquo;re already there.\n  Make a new column by fetching English labels (Property Len). Add \u0026ldquo;Cabinet\u0026rdquo; to the end. Fill down.\n  Filter wizara column by ordinal numbers (al-ula, etc), then add English equivalent to Cabinet column.\n  Some foreign ministers' terms cover two cabinets. Filter for these, clean up end dates, etc, then delete the excess rows.\n  Reconcile Arabic cabinet names against Wikidata. Straightforward enough, because they are already there from the Wikipedia pages, but they are empty.\n  Add description, using \u0026ldquo;Egyptian government formed in \u0026quot; plus year in start column.\n  Add head of state column, manually with khedives, reconcile, then fill down.\n  Add follows, followed by, reconcile.\n  Map to schema.\n  Cut and paste all of the cabinet tables from the various cabinet pages, in sequence, into spreadsheet.\n  Filter for prime Minsters, Add column with them.\n  Match them with their cabinets (by hand)\n  Note: Image from Wikimedia Commons\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2020-11-18-cabinet-to-wikidata/","tags":["Wikidata","OpenRefine","Egypt"],"title":"Egypt's cabinets in Wikidata"},{"categories":["Computational methods"],"contents":"I am experimenting with Wikidata as a research data repository.

Wikipedia to OpenRefine In the first video, I take a list of 353 Egyptian men given the title \u0026ldquo;pasha\u0026rdquo; between 1910 and 1952, from this Arabic wikipedia page, and begin to tidy it in OpenRefine.\n  2. Dates Here I change the dates of appointment into YYYY-MM-DD format.\n  3. Given names Here I add a column containing each pasha\u0026rsquo;s given name.\n  4. Wikidata reconciliation Here I find how many of these fellows are already in Wikidata. For those already present, I will only want to update their records to add the title \u0026ldquo;pasha\u0026rdquo; and the date. For those men not yet in Wikidata, I will want to create a whole new item.\n  5. Adding data from a second source Here I start to incorporate a different list, which gives the same information in English, from Samir Rafaat\u0026rsquo;s redoubtable egy.com.\n  6. Combining Arabic and English lists Here I explain how I brought together the Arabic and English lists. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I did this in a very efficient manner, but so it goes. I considered it worth some effort to add these English transliterations, because they will really enrich the Wikidata items.\n  7. Wikidata schema My OpenRefine file is clean, consistent, and complete. In this video I map it to a Wikidata schema, which describes the kind of information that I want to upload. Then I upload the material.\n  8. Querying Wikidata Here I will upload a video showing how this pasha data can be used once it\u0026rsquo;s in Wikidata.\nNote: The image of a Shriner\u0026rsquo;s hat from Tampa, Florida is pilfered without permission from pinterest, but I excused myself because Orientalism.\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2020-11-18-pashas-to-wikidata/","tags":["Wikidata","OpenRefine","Egypt"],"title":"Pashas into Wikidata"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I am a legal and social historian of the Middle East.

The city commissioners were there, as well as student government leaders and FSU administrators. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the city’s plan to improve pedestrian safety on Tennessee Street by reducing traffic lanes from six to four.\nNo one in that room will forget the ambush we witnessed. The city proposed this trial in response to FSU’s request to make Tennessee safer. Out of the blue and after months of public consultation, FSU announced its strong opposition to the plan. Behind this opposition (alongside carefully orchestrated opposition from “small business owners” on Tennessee street, most now out of business) were investors seeking to boost their CollegeTown projects. Weeks later, the state Department of Transportation (which has authority over Tennessee) put the final nail in the coffin. The status quo remained on Tennessee.\nI thought of this meeting when I heard of Natalie Nickchen’s death. I thought of a colleague still dealing with injuries she suffered years ago as she crossed Tennessee for a coffee. I thought of my student who has missed the last three weeks of class because he too was struck while walking down a sidewalk on Tennessee. I thought of the dozens of traffic deaths and serious injuries suffered north, south, east and west of campus over the last decade.\nStudents use the crosswalk between Woodward Avenue and Stadium Drive to cross West Tennessee Street Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2020. Natalie Nickchen, an FSU student, was killed in the crosswalk after being hit by a car last week.\nThe proposed pedestrian bridge is the sort of expensive unicorn intervention that policy makers (and contractors) prefer, but it will prevent only a small share of FSU’s crashes. Planners of yesteryear chose to run a highway through the middle of a major university. Building a pedestrian bridge endorses their choice to put traffic ahead of the university community. But we can make other choices.\nUnfortunately, there is no silver bullet. Greater policing enforcement will help, but it is only a Band-Aid — especially if police focus on pedestrians rather than drivers. Blaming the victim by putting the safety burden on pedestrians, following the Street Scene columnist’s advice, is an outmoded recipe for more disasters.\nThe Florida DOT — last in the nation in protecting pedestrians — is not going to fix this problem. If we really want to improve the safety of our community, we need a comprehensive, FSU-led effort to change the physical environment and culture of transportation in and around campus.\nWe already know how to make streets safer. Safe Routes to School has established a model of thorough evaluation and targeted tweaks. The Vision Zero movement, adopted by cities around the country, is another model of small, steady steps towards harm reduction. Durable safety does not have to be costly, but it requires careful thought and sustained leadership.\nFSU must do everything it can to protect the precious young people in our charge. We are making changes to protect them from gun violence, from hazing, from sexual assault. CDC statistics show that traffic is the leading cause of death and injury to young people in the United States. We can’t afford another decade ignoring traffic violence.\nNote: Originally published in the Tallahassee Democrat.

We rarely hear anyone in public life dispute this principle in words.\nDeeds are another matter. Segregation, discrimination and inequality have always been at the heart of the American story. Leon County’s current charter school debate is only the latest example of how ready we are to say one thing but mean another.\nBoth the new charter applicants —Tallahassee Classical School and Plato Academy —describe their projects in terms that appear unobjectionable. Tallahassee Classical offers a “traditional liberal arts classical education” that is “time-proven with a history of over 2500 years in the West”; Plato draws on the Greek tradition which constitutes “the philosophical underpinnings of Western thought.”\nBut the so-called Western tradition offers terms we can use to understand this language.\nCircumlocution (from the Latin) and periphrasis (from the Greek) mean talking evasively around the real issue. The real issue is that this “classical” language is code for a Eurocentric, Christian worldview.\nA little research shows Tallahassee Classical is not the local, grassroots initiative it claims to be. The language of its application is almost identical to language used at dozens of similar schools across the U.S. Although the application notes its affiliation with Hillsdale College’s Barney Charter School Initiative, it is not frank about the depth of its devotion to this cause.\nHillsdale is a key site in the current culture wars; its partisans — from Betsy Devos to Dinesh D’Souza to Richard Corcoran — are deeply enmeshed with this local initiative. Googling various phrases from Tallahassee Classical’s application (try \u0026ldquo;faltered after the fall of Rome, made a slow but steady recovery\u0026rdquo;) reveals the topoi (Greek: places, motifs, categories) of this movement.\nNow, I have no objection to religious and ethnic schools, but such schools ought to be private. I object to the charter applicants’ misrepresentation of their separatist projects as public and open to all. I object to their use of coded language in order to obtain public funds.\nI applaud our school board and superintendent for standing up to their misleading claims. Charters (like private school vouchers) prevent Florida’s school districts from doing their job, which is to educate all children, even “the least of these” (to quote Matthew, a classic text of the Western canon).\nCharters siphon off the students who are easiest and cheapest to educate, and they can do it without regard for the needs of the many.\n“By their fruits ye shall know them,” Matthew tells us elsewhere. The school board knows all it needs to know about how charters increase inequalities.\nThe School of Arts and Sciences on Thomasville Road — certainly no bastion of cultural conservatism — enrolls fewer low income students (8.4 percent) than any other school in the district. Governor’s Charter is segregated in its own right, and the company spends as little as it can actually educating its (mostly black) pupils, bumping any “difficult” kids back to the district’s public schools.\nThe student bodies at Florida’s 12 existing Classical and Plato Academies are wealthier and whiter than other schools in their districts. Despite applicants’ claims to the contrary, our school board would be naive to think things would be any different if these movements open branches in Tallahassee.\nYou don’t need a classical education to recognize a Trojan horse. These are schools for the few, not the many.\nNote: Originally published in the Tallahassee Democrat.

Joris was involved with two of the terrorisms of the turn of the century: anarchism and Armenian nationalism. The young man had moved from Antwerp to Istanbul in 1901. He found a job at the Singer sewing machine factory and struck up a friendship with the man at the next workbench, an Armenian. Joris accompanied this friend to meetings of the activist cell planning the attack and facilitated their preparations in various ways. Crucially, he placed an order for a custom-made carriage, fashioned with a cavity large enough to hold an explosive “infernal machine.”\nOn July 21, 1905, the conspirators parked the carriage along the route of Sultan Abdulhamid II\u0026rsquo;s weekly procession from the Yildiz palace. Fitted with a timer, it was set to explode as the sultan passed. As luck would have it, on this day the sultan paused on his path and avoided the blast. Twenty-six others were killed and many more injured. Most of the Armenian conspirators fled the country immediately. Joris, a naive personality, remained in Istanbul; he did not understand the Armenian language and may have been excluded from the escape plan. The Ottoman police picked him up a week later, tracking him down using the delivery ledger of the carriage merchant. He was tried and sentenced to death.\nThe Joris affair is not well known, but it came up almost immediately after the 22 March bombings in Brussels, when an attempted meme about Joris surfaced on a Turkish site: “The Belgian killer who introduced Turks to terror; that same terror has returned to Belgium 100 years later.” Columnist Murat Bardakçı made the same connection. This crude “bomb here, bomb there” reminder does not yield much insight. The many parallels between anarchist terrorism at the turn of the twentieth century and Islamist terrorism at the turn of the twenty-first offer more food for thought. Today\u0026rsquo;s international movement seeking to overturn the world order through radically transgressive acts is not unprecedented. Starting in the 1880s, anarchist “propaganda of the deed” attacks took place in Europe, the US, and the Middle East. A series of studies comparing anarchist terrorism and Islamist terrorism has elucidated similarities and differences in anarchist and Islamist motives. There has been little comparison of the popular terror and state repression that the two movements elicited. It is nothing new that attacks in Brussels and Paris get more attention than attacks in Ankara, Baghdad, or Lahore. Despite work showing that the eastern Mediterranean was an important stage for anarchists, the division of terrorism into notable and forgotten spheres endures. Mike Davis' history of the car bomb, for example, traces its origins to a horse wagon on Wall Street in 1920, overlooking the Yildiz carriage of 1905. One way around this competition for attention is to compare the reaction of the Belgian and Turkish states to the Yildiz and the Brussels attacks.\nThis comparison reveals small states seeking to leverage terrorist events to bolster alliances and garner the support of great powers. For present-day Turkey and Belgium, the attacks offer a plethora of safe small steps in a bigger prestige contest. After the Brussels bombings, Turkish President Erdogan blamed Belgium\u0026rsquo;s intelligence failings. This was not ex post facto critique, however; it accorded with Turkish grousing days before the attack about Belgian tolerance for PKK protesters. Thanks to this “gotcha” moment, Turkey was able to cast itself as reliable, even respectable. The failings of Belgium\u0026rsquo;s embattled nation-state project have been blamed for its apparent vulnerability to terrorism, with pundits questioning the state’s trustworthiness as a military ally. But various parties in Belgium will doubtless seek to ride the coattails of global fear of terrorist attacks towards local power, and they will want the support of bigger fish than Benyamin Netanyahu.\nThe 1905 Joris affair also produced a series of Belgian and Ottoman performances pitched to a world audience. The conviction of Joris triggered a legal and diplomatic crisis between the two states, both of which tried (without great success) to engage the support of greater powers. Under a legal system called the capitulations, European residents of the Ottoman empires were exempt from many forms of Ottoman law and taxation. By the nineteenth century, this system, which emerged in the sixteenth century as unilateral privileges dispensed by the sultan to European subjects, took the form of unequal treaties in favor of European states. Minor powers such as Belgium, Brazil, and the United States signed their capitulations treaties with the Ottomans in the 1830s. But sizable (and poor) European migrant communities in Ottoman cities became a headache for consuls, and in the second half of the nineteenth century these foreign authorities turned the criminal prosecution of foreigners over to the Ottoman courts. The capitulations stipulated that sentences on foreigners were to be carried out by consular authorities, but after the 1870s even these sentences were typically executed by Ottoman authorities and foreign convicts were incarcerated in Ottoman prisons.\nOttoman authorities were unwilling to follow standard procedure and turn Joris over to Belgian authorities for execution of his sentence. First, the crime was attempted regicide, which was no ordinary crime, and Joris was an anarchist associated with Armenian “terrorists,” which made him no ordinary criminal. When Joris was sentenced to death by the Ottoman court, a second problem arose: Belgium (responsible for carrying out any Ottoman sentences against its own nationals) had abandoned capital punishment decades earlier. There were few Belgian subjects in the Ottoman empire, and neither government could point to much precedent. (American authorities wrestled with similar jurisdiction problems in the 1905 case of Charles Vartanian and Hovhanes Afarian, Armenian activists who were naturalized U.S. citizens.) Through 1906 and 1907, Joris languished in Ottoman prison in a sort of legal limbo.\nDiplomatic notes flew back and forth between the Belgian and Ottoman foreign ministries in the months after the trial, but there was no appreciable progress towards a settlement. The law school of Macquarie University has posted a compilation of coverage of this exchange as published in the Times of London. Meanwhile, two prominent lawyers argued the case in the pages of the Revue de droit international et de législation comparée. On the Ottoman side, foreign ministry lawyer (and future foreign minister) Gabriel Noradounghian (1852-1936) argued that both judgment and execution were central organs of territorial sovereignty, and these powers could never be transferred to another state. Albéric Rolin (1843-1937), secretary-general of the Institut du droit international, a body that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1904, advocated for the Belgian side. Whereas in 1894 Rolin had argued strongly in the pages of the Revue that anarchy was a crime “against all states, to be combated by all available means,” now he privileged compatriotism. He insisted that Belgium had extraterritorial rights over Joris under treaty and custom, suggesting that the only reason that the Ottomans refused to comply with Belgium’s request was because Belgium was a “petit pays” that could not threaten the Empire with force.\nThen and now, the threat of force is never far from extraterritorial claims. Although territorial jurisdiction is a leading principle of the modern international legal regime, it faces considerable pressures in the present moment. This pressure draws on the claim that terrorism warrants forceful response and the fact that only great powers possess the requisite force, in the form of invading armies, covert forces, drones, or “investigators,” to fight terrorism. Small states defend their territorial jurisdiction by claiming anti-terror competence.\nAs we have seen, the claim to competence can be developed on the back of other, less competent small states—especially non-European and non-Christian ones. This was equally true in the nineteenth century. The Belgian law on the organization and jurisdiction of consulates of 31 December 1851 stated that any Belgian charged with a crime in a non-Christian country must be tried in Belgium. Decades of Ottoman administrative and legal reforms aimed to obviate claims such as this—and the numerous nineteenth century territorial invasions that they occasioned. But even in 1906, thirty years after the secularized, codified Ottoman nizami legal reforms, a domestic Belgian legal journal could maintain European civilizational privilege: “We must note that the Turkish law is [only] the Qur’an, that the whole Oriental system of law is purely religious, and that, so long as this system remains as it is, the idea of ‘non-Christian countries’ will remain a necessary concept for all European peoples.”\nIf the direction of disdain is reversed today, with Belgium now cast in the role of the “sick man”, the dynamic of small state competition remains the same. Belgium\u0026rsquo;s territorial jurisdiction seems likely to be overrun by greater, more “competent” authorities. Europe\u0026rsquo;s move to further enforce its border controls may well extend to the borders and airports—classic sites of extraterritorial action—of states it deems insecure. Turkey has thus far avoided such encroachments (sometimes militarily), and will continue to ruthlessly extend its credentials of competency by combatting Da‘esh, Kurds, Gulenists, academics, Syrian refugees, and many others.\nIn these maneuvers, as in so much of international law, ordinary people disappear, subsumed in their nationality categories and overwhelmed by state actors. Edouard Joris was finally released in 1907, returning to a quiet life in Belgium. We know little about the other “conspirators” tried and convicted along with him. Then and now, the international threat of terrorism creates perverse incentives for small states to exercise harsh territorial sovereignty over their own nationals in order to curry the favor of big states and forestall their interventions.\nNote: this piece was originally published on Jadaliyya.

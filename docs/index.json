[{"categories":["Opinion"],"contents":"Last month, our city police TAC team received training from a man convicted of an atrocity. The TPD costs local taxpayers more than any other service. They have the power of arrest and the right to use lethal force. Members of the public (those who pay the bills) ought to have the right to ask questions about this and other aspects of our police force.\nUnfortunately, many in the police and city leadership do not see it this way. I realized this when I asked about the training at the last City Commission meeting. I was surprised by the reaction of Chief Lawrence Revell. He spoke for 12 minutes in a voice trembling with anger, turning several times to glare directly at me. The first time he interrupted a commissioner, the mayor asked him to stop, but after that he was allowed to talk over our elected officials who are his bosses.\nRevell is a grown man with a gun at his belt and a $60 million budget at his disposal. As I watched him talk, I wondered how my routine and predictable question could trigger such a defensive and evasive reaction.\nA screenshot of author and journalist Wesley Morgan\u0026rsquo;s Twitter post on Eddie Gallagher\u0026rsquo;s training of Tallahassee Police Department officers. The chief attacked his critics but misrepresented our concerns. The problem is not that Eddie Gallagher, the criminal in question, took photos, or that his photos appeared on social media. The problem is not whether TPD contracted or paid the abuser. The problem is not that those who question policy somehow perversely want “Uvalde to happen here” or “another officer’s funeral.”\nThe problem is keeping bad company when the public has so many questions about police use of force. Gallagher’s presence was no coincidence, and he was never a neutral observer. He markets a warrior brand built in part on his military training, but especially on the wartime atrocities he brags about and on scorn for due process investigations of misconduct.. He embodies the most divisive and militarized approach to policing. Crucially, the phenomenon is not limited to this one man. The culture of combat cosplay, involving alarming ideas about law, race, religion, and gender, haunts city streets and rural compounds. Choosing to associate with representatives of that culture, rather than avoid them, shows poor judgment.\nThe problem is accountability. Combat culture treats civilians as weak, as dupes, as dummies. It is impossible not to hear its echoes in slippery responses to reasonable questions. After initially denying any connection with “somebody [who] was there that did something that they shouldn’t have done,” the chief changed tack: “Did he provide input? He probably did\u0026hellip;” At one point, a commissioner asked him, “the patrol officer is not the one getting that kind of training?” “Correct,” he replied. In fact, the TAC team is made up of officers from various branches, including patrol officers.\nThere is a deeper problem behind this peevish response to basic input. For years, police and city leadership has rebuffed and ignored critics. When citizens turned to peaceful street protest, they faced overwhelming force, and 19 were arrested. After HB1, no one protests anymore—it’s too dangerous. The Citizen’s Police Review Board can’t get a hearing with the city commission. Commissioners who do not applaud the police get interrupted and scorned.\nEarlier in the same meeting, a group of faith leaders shared sobering tales of the cost of gun violence in our city. None of them blamed the police, or even mentioned them. But is it unreasonable to expect our “guardians” to prioritize protecting the people actually dying in Tallahassee? Meeting after meeting, we hear from concerned citizens working to end violence in our community. Are we not ignoring their pleas when we associate with those who glorify it?\nThe chief began his response to my question by quoting John 8:32 (“The truth will set you free”). I thought instead of Galatians 4:16 (“Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?”)\nNote: Originally published in the Tallahassee Democrat.\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2022-09-16-tpd-militarization/","tags":["Police","Tallahassee"],"title":"TPD needs a culture of accountability"},{"categories":["Opinion"],"contents":"For a decade, Florida State University has courted the U.S. News rankings with singular focus and remarkable success. Our university has joined the big leagues, and it intends to keep moving up. That’s the job our trustees have set for FSU’s next president. What will it take?\nEvery single candidate for the job has the same answer: money — or, as one first round candidate put it, \u0026ldquo;money, money, money, money, money.\u0026rdquo;\nBut where is that money to be found?\nFor John Thrasher and his predecessors, the answer was straightforward: the Florida Legislature. And President Thrasher successfully procured the state funding we needed to make it to our present position.\nBecause of our new standing, though, the answer has changed. Now that FSU is a Top 20 university, the path forward goes beyond the Capitol.\nIn 2018-19, FSU’s $499 million in state appropriations made up 35% of its budget. The University of Florida got a lot more money from the state — $785 million — but that was only 23% of its revenue. FSU is an outlier in this regard. On average, the top 30 schools got just 15% of their revenue from state allocations. You can see a data visualization here.\nTo be clear, this does not mean that FSU gets too much money from the state. It means FSU’s revenue growth must come from other sources — especially federal research funding.\nFew of us follow such budget details closely. This presidential search has been eye opening for everyone. As one trustee put it, “I should have paid more attention, and I should have known, that we were lacking severely\u0026hellip; and for that I apologize.”\nWe’ve learned FSU needs to increase its research budget by about $250 million. That kind of money will not come from the state Legislature, where a $10-million increase is a big win. The Legislature has to balance the interests of many worthy and deserving institutions. It will not bankrupt everyone else to boost FSU.\nWhat does all this mean for FSU\u0026rsquo;s presidential search?\nThe selection committee has done a great job. We have three excellent finalists, each a distinguished scientist with deep experience finding and managing hundreds of millions— even billions — in research funding. Each is an expert in exactly the work this job now requires.\nThe days of relying on Tallahassee connections as the most important moneymaker have come to an end. Our success is a tribute to the hard work of past presidents — and the taxpayers who support us. But the next step requires different tools and a different kind of leader.\nFSU will always need great relationships at the Capitol, and we are thankful for the ongoing state support that will remain foundational to our university. But our next president will be the first with priorities beyond state appropriations.\nJohn Thrasher was FSU\u0026rsquo;s last politician president. It’s a mark of his success that he will be followed by an academic who can harness our tremendous research potential.\nNote: Originally published in the Tallahassee Democrat.\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2021-05-23-fsu-president/","tags":["FSU","Florida"],"title":"John Thrasher should be Florida State's last politician president"},{"categories":["Computational methods"],"contents":" I am a hater of Wikipedia haters. It drives me up the wall when my kids\u0026rsquo; history teachers ban them from using it. I use it all the time, even for topics I pretend to have mastered.\nHorsing around with Wikipedia I\u0026rsquo;m writing a book about international law in Cairo. One chapter is a study of a huge probate case (Antun Yusuf \u0026lsquo;Abd al-Messih) that began in 1885. As I was investigating the background of Antun\u0026rsquo;s debtors, I started reading about Ali Pasha Sherif, whose luxury lifestyle was funded by loans of up to £100,000. I remembered Ali Pasha as one of the slaveholding elites described in Eve Troutt Powell\u0026rsquo;s 2003 A Different Shade of Colonialism.\nComputational methods are key to my work on this book. I\u0026rsquo;m trying (so far without great success) to describe the basic producers of the wealth that fueled litigation of the sort that I\u0026rsquo;m examining. To that end, I\u0026rsquo;m working to tie all my datasets into Wikidata, which is the leading linked data hub. Wikidata is fuelled in part by Wikipedia, and I was pleased to see that Ali Pasha has an entry.\nLike many entries about Middle East topics, it\u0026rsquo;s quixotic. Its earliest iteration is a paraphrase of a page from an old AOL site by a California enthusiast of \u0026ldquo;Egyptian Arabian Sport Horses.\u0026rdquo; Not surprisingly, it has more to say about Ali\u0026rsquo;s horses than the man himself. But it said that he was Egypt\u0026rsquo;s foreign minister; of course I immediately thrilled to the idea of international legal precedent established by the personal debts of a colonized foreign secretary.\nTo the credit of my kids\u0026rsquo; history teachers, Wikipedia was wrong: Ali Pasha was never Egypt\u0026rsquo;s minister (though his brother was Ottoman foreign minister). To my credit, Wikipedia is no longer wrong: I corrected the error and tidied up the page. Thanks to the enthusiast who produced the original text, I learned some things about the Egyptian horse market in the 1870s and 80s, and I came better to understand Ali\u0026rsquo;s debts to Antun. And as I tried to figure out who had and had not been Egypt\u0026rsquo;s foreign minister, I discovered another enthusiast: عادل, who has made thousands and thousands and thousands of contributions to Arabic wikipedia, including an incredible set of pages listing Egyptian Ministers, among them a complete page on the foreign ministers.\nListing foreign ministers In a burst of enthusiasm, I got down to work replicating Adil\u0026rsquo;s Arabic ministers list in English. I made it to 1930 before I ran out of steam. I was worn down by a few factors:\nmy own desire to move on to the next thing before finishing the task at hand MediaWiki\u0026rsquo;s table syntax, which is a bit intricate to do by hand (I realize now I should just have used a convertor) missing Wikipedia entries for many of the foreign ministers of Egypt (the topic of the rest of this section) a sense that I should fill out this dataset in a more portable format (which is the topic of the rest of this post) Wikipedia entries on Middle East topics are a treasure trove of resources, especially if you work your way through the \u0026ldquo;Languages\u0026rdquo; links at the bottom of the left hand menu. The foreign ministers list looks very different in English, Arabic, and German. The Persian version is based on the Arabic page before Adil upgraded it, while the Russian version appears to be its own animal. Considering the importance of Egypt to France (and vice versa), it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable that there is no French page.\nAs I worked to mirror the Arabic list in English, I found that several ministers had Arabic pages without English counterparts. I made brief, rough stub pages for\nWasif Boutros Ghali Ali Zulfikar Pasha Tigrane Pasha Nakhla George al-Motyei Pasha None of these is great work, but they\u0026rsquo;re enough for others to build out if and when they feel the need.\nAs is often the case, the fine folks who volunteer to keep Wikipedia tidy were cautious to accept thinly referenced new entries. Their position is reasonable enough. At the same time, the effort to expand Wikipedia beyond dead white men sometimes founders on the lack of easily accessible, English-language secondary sources. Wikipedia editors tend to reflexively expect reference to such sources to verify notability. It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough when there\u0026rsquo;s a Times obituary (as there is for Tigrane Pasha). It\u0026rsquo;s more difficult if you build your page entirely on a paragraph in Zirikli\u0026rsquo;s al-A\u0026rsquo;lam, which is what I usually do.\nThings get easier when there\u0026rsquo;s an entry in Arabic wikipedia that you can mirror. Best of all is if the subject is an author who can be found in VIAF: The Virtual International Authority File and WorldCat. Linking to those authority controls usually makes the case for notability clear. In addition, these catalogues provide an easy list of books to add to the Wikipedia entry.\nIt takes a bit of time to make a new page, however, and there were dozens of such pages required to fill out the list of Egypt\u0026rsquo;s foreign ministers. Many of these men were less notable, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel up to doing the digging.\nClosed versus open formats While I was searching up the lesser-known names on the list, I came across another amazing Wikipedia contribution from Adil: in 2016 he created a page for every Egyptian cabinet from 1878 to the present. Our brilliant friend produced tables listing every minister and ministry. He drew his information from encyclopedic works by Mohammad al-Gawadi, Younan Labib Rizk, and others, and he cites these sources scrupulously.\nWhen I saw these lists, I thought that I could approach this problem differently. Instead of spending a month writing Wikipedia pages, I could spend a few days converting these well-formatted and standardized tables into a format that I could upload to Wikidata.\nWhat is the difference between Wikipedia and Wikidata? Wikipedia is written by and for human readers. While there are automatic bots that crawl through the pages to standardize spelling and dates and categorize pages, almost all of the work is done \u0026ldquo;by hand.\u0026rdquo; Wikidata, on the other hand, is written for and (to a large extent) by automatic readers. It is an elaborately structured dataset based on a fascinating category structure (or ontology) that attempts to describe all existence.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t bore the few readers who have made it this far with rhapsodies about Wikidata. Suffice it to say that this dataset nourishes all sorts of automated reasoning about our world. Those committed to combatting Eurocentrism do well to contribute data to this pool, which tilts very, very white, male, and wealthy. Egyptian ministerial data is not the ideal remedy for that problem. It is an improvement on what\u0026rsquo;s there, however. Even more important, any information that is already digitized, cleaned, and structured is fairly easy to upload. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what I resolved to do.\nThis undertaking is not purely altruistic. I expect to be able to use it to support my own research as well. Wikidata has a query service that uses the powerful SPARQL language. It\u0026rsquo;s fun for trivia: here\u0026rsquo;s a query for the first names of everyone (for whom a first name and birthplace is recorded) who was born in Cairo (press play to get it to run). It can also be fun for more serious questions, so long as the dataset is relatively complete. That\u0026rsquo;s what I set out to do with the ministers.\nDocumenting the process The next part of this post is fairly dry. I\u0026rsquo;m recording details so that others searching for a \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo; can learn from my attempts, and so that I can remember what I did. If you\u0026rsquo;re not interested in the step-by-step, I urge you to jump to the end.\nPreparing the data for OpenRefine Copy table contents from Arabic foreign ministers pages. It would be possible to automate this, but I did it manually in fifteen minutes.\nPaste tables into spreadsheet, figure out odd parts (mostly having to do with post-1952, when there were frequent prime minister changes but few minister changes), then paste results into plain text editor as tab separated values. Keep working till you have one line per ministry.\nCreate new table in OpenRefine.\nParse dates in OpenRefine until they are standardized. The easiest way to do this is to split the date into several columns (by space). Then\nReconcile Prime Minister names with Wikidata. This is easy, because they\u0026rsquo;re already there.\nMake a new column by fetching English labels (Property Len). Add \u0026ldquo;Cabinet\u0026rdquo; to the end. Fill down.\nFilter wizara column by ordinal numbers (al-ula, etc), then add English equivalent to Cabinet column.\nSome foreign ministers\u0026rsquo; terms cover two cabinets. Filter for these, clean up end dates, etc, then delete the excess rows.\nReconcile Arabic cabinet names against Wikidata. Straightforward enough, because they are already there from the Wikipedia pages, but they are empty.\nAdd description, using \u0026ldquo;Egyptian government formed in \u0026quot; plus year in start column.\nAdd head of state column, manually with khedives, reconcile, then fill down.\nAdd follows, followed by, reconcile.\nMap to schema.\nCut and paste all of the cabinet tables from the various cabinet pages, in sequence, into spreadsheet.\nFilter for prime Minsters, Add column with them.\nMatch them with their cabinets (by hand)\nNote: Image from Wikimedia Commons\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2020-11-18-cabinet-to-wikidata/","tags":["Wikidata","OpenRefine","Egypt"],"title":"Egypt's cabinets in Wikidata"},{"categories":["Computational methods"],"contents":"I am experimenting with Wikidata as a research data repository. If I systematically upload various datasets, can I a) make wikidata more global and useful, and b) learn more about my own evidence?\nI documented two recent projects, in two different ways.

In that post, I outline my reasoning in greater detail and offer some useful links about the process.\nHere, I want to share screen capture videos of my work to put Egyptian pashas into Wikidata. The videos, in sequence below, are soporifically self-explanatory. I haven\u0026rsquo;t done documentation like this before, and it was fun. I\u0026rsquo;m shocked at how much time I can spend talking about this stuff.\n1. Wikipedia to OpenRefine In the first video, I take a list of 353 Egyptian men given the title \u0026ldquo;pasha\u0026rdquo; between 1910 and 1952, from this Arabic wikipedia page, and begin to tidy it in OpenRefine.\n2. Dates Here I change the dates of appointment into YYYY-MM-DD format.\n3. Given names Here I add a column containing each pasha\u0026rsquo;s given name.\n4. Wikidata reconciliation Here I find how many of these fellows are already in Wikidata. For those already present, I will only want to update their records to add the title \u0026ldquo;pasha\u0026rdquo; and the date. For those men not yet in Wikidata, I will want to create a whole new item.\n5. Adding data from a second source Here I start to incorporate a different list, which gives the same information in English, from Samir Rafaat\u0026rsquo;s redoubtable egy.com.\n6. Combining Arabic and English lists Here I explain how I brought together the Arabic and English lists. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I did this in a very efficient manner, but so it goes. I considered it worth some effort to add these English transliterations, because they will really enrich the Wikidata items.\n7. Wikidata schema My OpenRefine file is clean, consistent, and complete. In this video I map it to a Wikidata schema, which describes the kind of information that I want to upload. Then I upload the material.\n8. Querying Wikidata Here I will upload a video showing how this pasha data can be used once it\u0026rsquo;s in Wikidata.\nNote: The image of a Shriner\u0026rsquo;s hat from Tampa, Florida is pilfered without permission from pinterest, but I excused myself because Orientalism.\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2020-11-18-pashas-to-wikidata/","tags":["Wikidata","OpenRefine","Egypt"],"title":"Pashas into Wikidata"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I am a legal and social historian of the Middle East.

What does this treaty and this race mean for these states? What does it mean for everyday sports and peace fans like us?\nShort answer: Countries are advertising campaigns that exist in community and competition with other brands. Israel, Bahrain, and UAE would prefer us to think they are only their image. We should mistrust their slogans and judge these brands by their works.\nOf course, countries are not mere slogans. Israel, for example, is the complex product of a century of anti-semitism, mass murder, political contest, economic experimentation, technology, colonialism, migration, etc etc. None of this is mere words. Just ask a Palestinian.\nIn recent years, however, it has suited Israel\u0026rsquo;s promoters to treat Israel as a slogan. Slogans don\u0026rsquo;t abide investigation or questioning. Objections can be dismissed summarily and categorically.\nEmbracing the facade also helps Israel to find \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; UAE and Bahrain exemplify the kind of branding some want: a sunny, wealthy, globalized veneer conceals autocracy, violence, and rights differentiated by caste. Don\u0026rsquo;t look behind the curtain!\nThis is the pageant we saw in DC: states with few historic or existing ties in a ritual with few genuine consequences for their citizens. There\u0026rsquo;s certainly scarce domestic need for these agreements. Away from the bright lights, non-citizens continue to suffer in the shadows.\nIsrael\u0026rsquo;s intransigence in the face of criticism is no doubt a model and an inspiration for Bahrain and UAE. International scrutiny is a disaster for these authoritarian regimes. There are plenty of reasons to boycott them. (All this is even more true of Saudi Arabia.)\nBut now you are asking: what does all this have to do with bike racing? Glad we are getting to the heart of the matter. For me, bike racing is like laws and sausages: a shiny casing concealing ground tough flesh.\nCycling teams are commodities, racers are billboards.

If you\u0026rsquo;re going to host branches of the Louvre and fancy universities, you might as well have bike races as well. Qatar hosted a tour from 2002 to 2016, when it also hosted the world championships.\nMore recently, the Emirates and Oman began their own national Tours.

He inherited Quebec property corporation Iberville and ran it with great success. In 2015, he founded the Israel team, moving it up through the ranks.\nIn 2018, Adams paid to bring the Giro d\u0026rsquo;Italia start to Israel. Hosting this international sporting event was a major publicity coup in an era of boycotts.

It is thus an ideal environment for outsider states to perform a pantomime of normalcy.

The city commissioners were there, as well as student government leaders and FSU administrators. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the city’s plan to improve pedestrian safety on Tennessee Street by reducing traffic lanes from six to four.\nNo one in that room will forget the ambush we witnessed. The city proposed this trial in response to FSU’s request to make Tennessee safer. Out of the blue and after months of public consultation, FSU announced its strong opposition to the plan. Behind this opposition (alongside carefully orchestrated opposition from “small business owners” on Tennessee street, most now out of business) were investors seeking to boost their CollegeTown projects. Weeks later, the state Department of Transportation (which has authority over Tennessee) put the final nail in the coffin. The status quo remained on Tennessee.\nI thought of this meeting when I heard of Natalie Nickchen’s death. I thought of a colleague still dealing with injuries she suffered years ago as she crossed Tennessee for a coffee. I thought of my student who has missed the last three weeks of class because he too was struck while walking down a sidewalk on Tennessee. I thought of the dozens of traffic deaths and serious injuries suffered north, south, east and west of campus over the last decade.\nStudents use the crosswalk between Woodward Avenue and Stadium Drive to cross West Tennessee Street Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2020. Natalie Nickchen, an FSU student, was killed in the crosswalk after being hit by a car last week.\nThe proposed pedestrian bridge is the sort of expensive unicorn intervention that policy makers (and contractors) prefer, but it will prevent only a small share of FSU’s crashes. Planners of yesteryear chose to run a highway through the middle of a major university. Building a pedestrian bridge endorses their choice to put traffic ahead of the university community. But we can make other choices.\nUnfortunately, there is no silver bullet. Greater policing enforcement will help, but it is only a Band-Aid — especially if police focus on pedestrians rather than drivers. Blaming the victim by putting the safety burden on pedestrians, following the Street Scene columnist’s advice, is an outmoded recipe for more disasters.\nThe Florida DOT — last in the nation in protecting pedestrians — is not going to fix this problem. If we really want to improve the safety of our community, we need a comprehensive, FSU-led effort to change the physical environment and culture of transportation in and around campus.\nWe already know how to make streets safer. Safe Routes to School has established a model of thorough evaluation and targeted tweaks. The Vision Zero movement, adopted by cities around the country, is another model of small, steady steps towards harm reduction. Durable safety does not have to be costly, but it requires careful thought and sustained leadership.\nFSU must do everything it can to protect the precious young people in our charge. We are making changes to protect them from gun violence, from hazing, from sexual assault. CDC statistics show that traffic is the leading cause of death and injury to young people in the United States.

We rarely hear anyone in public life dispute this principle in words.\nDeeds are another matter. Segregation, discrimination and inequality have always been at the heart of the American story. Leon County’s current charter school debate is only the latest example of how ready we are to say one thing but mean another.\nBoth the new charter applicants —Tallahassee Classical School and Plato Academy —describe their projects in terms that appear unobjectionable. Tallahassee Classical offers a “traditional liberal arts classical education” that is “time-proven with a history of over 2500 years in the West”; Plato draws on the Greek tradition which constitutes “the philosophical underpinnings of Western thought.”\nBut the so-called Western tradition offers terms we can use to understand this language.\nCircumlocution (from the Latin) and periphrasis (from the Greek) mean talking evasively around the real issue. The real issue is that this “classical” language is code for a Eurocentric, Christian worldview.\nA little research shows Tallahassee Classical is not the local, grassroots initiative it claims to be. The language of its application is almost identical to language used at dozens of similar schools across the U.S. Although the application notes its affiliation with Hillsdale College’s Barney Charter School Initiative, it is not frank about the depth of its devotion to this cause.\nHillsdale is a key site in the current culture wars; its partisans — from Betsy Devos to Dinesh D’Souza to Richard Corcoran — are deeply enmeshed with this local initiative. Googling various phrases from Tallahassee Classical’s application (try \u0026ldquo;faltered after the fall of Rome, made a slow but steady recovery\u0026rdquo;) reveals the topoi (Greek: places, motifs, categories) of this movement.\nNow, I have no objection to religious and ethnic schools, but such schools ought to be private. I object to the charter applicants’ misrepresentation of their separatist projects as public and open to all. I object to their use of coded language in order to obtain public funds.\nI applaud our school board and superintendent for standing up to their misleading claims. Charters (like private school vouchers) prevent Florida’s school districts from doing their job, which is to educate all children, even “the least of these” (to quote Matthew, a classic text of the Western canon).\nCharters siphon off the students who are easiest and cheapest to educate, and they can do it without regard for the needs of the many.\n“By their fruits ye shall know them,” Matthew tells us elsewhere. The school board knows all it needs to know about how charters increase inequalities.\nThe School of Arts and Sciences on Thomasville Road — certainly no bastion of cultural conservatism — enrolls fewer low income students (8.4 percent) than any other school in the district. Governor’s Charter is segregated in its own right, and the company spends as little as it can actually educating its (mostly black) pupils, bumping any “difficult” kids back to the district’s public schools.\nThe student bodies at Florida’s 12 existing Classical and Plato Academies are wealthier and whiter than other schools in their districts. Despite applicants’ claims to the contrary, our school board would be naive to think things would be any different if these movements open branches in Tallahassee.\nYou don’t need a classical education to recognize a Trojan horse. These are schools for the few, not the many.\nNote: Originally published in the Tallahassee Democrat.

This version reorganizes the data in a way I should have long ago. I had listed each place as its own row, with each successive reorganizations listed one after another, resulting in more than 100 columns and many empty cells. Now I\u0026rsquo;ve listed each place as its own record, with successive reorganizations listed one on top of the other. This means far fewer columns, which will make the RDF mapping much more efficient.\nI used a concatenation/explosion technique to do this. I added a new column based on the first column in each numbered set of 10-11 columns (\u0026ldquo;Admin_unit_1\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;Belongs_to_1_1-code\u0026rdquo;).

After I\u0026rsquo;d done this for all 14 series, I deleted the atomized columns, leaving only these 14 concatenated columns. Then, after double checking that I was working with records rather than rows, I used the \u0026ldquo;transpose cells across columns into rows\u0026rdquo; command, transposing into one column and ignoring blank cells. I removed the 66,000-odd empty rows that resulted (filtering the concatenation column by blank). Finally, I exploded the contents of the resulting column, splitting into several columns using the \u0026lt;\u0026gt; separator.\nThe first time I did this, I thought I should record how I did it. I failed to do so, and perhaps as a result I managed to corrupt my file a few days later. I had to do the whole thing again (it took about half an hour), and this time I did document the process.\nThe resulting document contains twice as many rows (11989) but only 1/6 as many columns (25). I added a \u0026ldquo;sequence\u0026rdquo; column, ordering the succession of units for each place name in case I need this information later. I also added a \u0026ldquo;capitalized\u0026rdquo; boolean column. Sezen seems to have capitalized the leading placenames, but I won\u0026rsquo;t need this marker in my database. I\u0026rsquo;ve converted all the Uppercase names to Camel Case, but I\u0026rsquo;m keeping this marker in case I find I need it.\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2017-12-09-back-to-multirow/","tags":["ottgaz","consolidation","GREL"],"title":"Back to multirow"},{"categories":["How to"],"contents":"Today I\u0026rsquo;m archiving (what I hope will be) the final non-RDF version of the Ottoman gazetteer. This version, Ottgaz-data-8, includes the dating work described in my last post, as well as wikidata, geonames, and periodo links.\nIt also contains a Duplicate? column, in which I mark 147 records that will be discarded in future versions of the gazetteer. Each of these records is an exact duplicate of another record in the dataset filed under a different lead placenames. The only difference is the order of placenames. Sezen required this redundancy in order to make his paper-based index useable, but this digital gazetteer does not.\nI found a good shortcut to identify duplicates. I created a column based on the placename_1 column using the GREL command forEach(cross(cell,\u0026quot;Ottgaz_rdf\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Placename_2@tr\u0026quot;),r,r.cells[\u0026quot;Placename_2@tr\u0026quot;].value).join(\u0026quot;|\u0026quot;), which fetched values whenever it found a value in placename_2 that matched placename_1. I then created temporary keys by concatenating several Admin_unit and Belongs_to columns. A text facet on these keys showed me matching pairs and sets, which often corresponded to duplicate entries, which shared the same attributes.\nI would guess that 200-300 more duplicate records remain in the database. I have retained these duplicates because they differ in more than just the name order. Two entries that concern the same place might differ slightly in one of their dates. In other cases, the differences are larger. An RDF database can tolerate and isolate inconsistencies of this sort. I will work to reconcile these duplicates once the RDF database is up and running.\nThe next step is to finalize the RDF skeleton (but I won\u0026rsquo;t manage to have it ready in time for Halloween).\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2017-10-31-reconciling-records/","tags":["ottgaz","duplication","dating","GREL"],"title":"Reconciling place names"},{"categories":["How to"],"contents":"Change over time is a conceptual challenge in any historical gazetteer. At this preliminary stage, the periodization requirements of the Ottoman gazetteer are relatively straightforward. I aim to represent changes in the Ottoman administrations\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the hierarchical organization of its territory. I do not seek to understand the duration and extent of Ottoman control in practice. I merely wish to record the approximate date on which each territorial unit was established by the administration. I will assume that the unit remained in place until it was superseded by a new one. Thus the dataset is periodized using start dates, and its end dates are derived from the start dates of any subsequent designation of the place in question.\nThis chart shows the distribution of dates in Sezen\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Osmanlı Yer Adları\u0026rdquo;:\nThe chart is responsive, so you can navigate its contents. Obviously, many of Sezen\u0026rsquo;s dates are post-Ottoman. Before the establishment of the Turkish Republic, the early 16th century and the mid to late 19th century are the periods with the largest number of place attestations.\nSezen\u0026rsquo;s dates are of four types (all expressed in the Gregorian calendar):\nYears (n=7445) Approximate years (designated by a ~, perhaps indicating mathematical translation into the Gregorian calendar; n=1090) Centuries (for instance, 16 yy.; n=585) Ranges (typically with two years given, e.g. 1541-1686, but sometimes only a terminal year, e.g. \u0026ldquo;1926 yılına kadar\u0026rdquo;; sometimes the date range refers to a century rather than a year; n=99) I\u0026rsquo;ve retained the raw dates as they appear in Sezen, except for date ranges, which I\u0026rsquo;ve transposed into start and stop dates.\nWith 534 different values, in four formats, it\u0026rsquo;s not immediately obvious how to ingest these dates into the Ottoman gazetteer. There are other reasons as well to think carefully about standardization. Sezen does not record the source(s) of his data, thus all of his dates must be considered provisional until confirmed with direct evidence. The dates revealed by that evidence will rarely be Gregorian, making Sezen\u0026rsquo;s data still more liable to adjustment.\nAs an alternative dating mechanism, I\u0026rsquo;m mapping Sezens dates onto the periodization of the Ottoman dynasty. This will allow the clustering of administrative changes under the reigns of the various sultans, a periodization that may engage the historiography more readily than the raw year counts.\nTo do this, I\u0026rsquo;m using a new Linked Data tool called PeriodO that \u0026ldquo;eases the task of linking among datasets that define periods differently.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve used the chronology of sultans in Clifford Edmund Bosworth\u0026rsquo;s The new Islamic dynasties : a chronological and genealogical manual(2014). The dates and their links can be found on PeriodO.\nBosworth\u0026rsquo;s solution to the problem of calendar conversion was simply to record the first Gregorian year that corresponded to the Hijri year in which each sultan came to power. In the notes field of each sultan\u0026rsquo;s record, I\u0026rsquo;ve recorded the Hijri date of ascent that I found on Wikipedia.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used a few shortcuts to map Sezen\u0026rsquo;s dates onto the sultans\u0026rsquo; reigns. I used approximate dates (~) as exact dates, mapped centuries to the sultan with the longest reign near the mid-point of the century, and used the first year of any date range as the mapping date. I mapped all years of transition (1876, for example) to the sultan whose reign began in that year. All dates after 1923 are assigned to the Turkish Republic (for which I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet established periods on PeriodO).\nObviously, this periodization scheme is a bit rough at the moment. Nevertheless, it should offer a general sense of the Ottoman territorial administrative structure over time. As more precise tools and data emerges, we can refine the Gazetteer.\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2017-10-28-dating-periodo/","tags":["ottgaz","periodo","dating"],"title":"Periodizing the Ottoman Gazetteer"},{"categories":["How to"],"contents":"This gazetteer is a transformation of tables in Tahir Sezen\u0026rsquo;s Osmanlı Yer Adları (Ottoman Place Names), available here and in many other places.

It uses the following fields:\nPlacename@tr (Sezen: İdârî Birimin Yeni Harflerle Adı) The name of the administrative unit in the Roman alphabet. While many places have just one name given, others have two or more variants, each of which appears in its own field (named Placename@tr 2, 3, 4, or 5). The current name of the place is given in all caps. There is also a Placename_notes field, containing Sezen\u0026rsquo;s comments. In many cases, this field should be amalgamated with the admin_unit_#_notes field. Placename@ott (Sezen: Eski Harflerle Adı) The name of the administrative unit in the Arabic alphabet. Only one name is given here, corresponding to the entry in placename@tr. Wikidata_url A link to the Wikidata page which corresponds (more or less) to the place in question. The lat/long coordinates and other data can be scraped from this link. Admin_unit_# (Sezen: Unvan) This field describes the position that the place occupied in the Ottoman administative hierarchy. The lowest numbers (i.e. Admin_unit_1) indicate earlier designations, the higher numbers (up to Admin_unit_14) indicate later designations. A dictionary of these terms appears below. In many cases, a year (or approximate year, or century) is given (admin_unit_#_year), corresponding to the date at which the place began to occupy its function. admin_unit_#_notes contains any notes that Sezen gives associated with this particular place and position. Belongs_to_#-# (Sezen: Bagli Olduğu Nahiye, Kaza, Sancak, Eyâlet veya Vilâyet) This field lists the superior administrative unit(s) to which the place in question belongs. I have broken each of these out into its own field, and they appear in sequence from subsidiary to superior. So, for instance, Belongs_to_1-1 contains Belongs_to_1-2.

I have used the field Ott_or_not to tag these two entities. For the most part, I have done this by hand. I have excluded batches of sites that are listed as merkez in their first listing, however. This designation was particular to the Republic, as far as I can see. Under the Republican scheme, every province had a merkez ilçe (subprovince) with the same name as the province, and the same practice was used for districts as well. So, for the most part, I\u0026rsquo;ve labeled such places as part of the Republic of Turkey (thus not part of the Ottoman hierarchy).\n","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2017-10-07-metadata-dictionary/","tags":["ottgaz","sezen","metadata","schema"],"title":"Metadata dictionary"},{"categories":["How to"],"contents":"The initial data for this gazetteer is a transformed version of Tahir Sezen\u0026rsquo;s 1996 Osmanlı Yer Adları. This post documents how I transformed it and contains links to archived versions of the various stages of the transformation.\n1. PDF to 3-column plain text spreadsheet The first step was to extract a workable table from the OCRed version of the PDF. I copied the text of the Sezen pdf and pasted it into a word processor document. Initially this was challenging, because the multiple lines of the tables were not conforming to the column arrangement when imported into a spreadsheet. It took me a while to figure out a method, as I couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to parse it by all caps or the alphabet switch. Luckily I realized that the font size of the Arabic-alphabet text differed. I used changes in font size to split the table into three columns: New alphabet name, old alphabet name, and a single field consisting of a long string describing the administrative classification of the place as well as the larger district containing it (Unvan ve Bağlı Olduğu Nahiye, Kaza, Sancak, Eyâlet veya Vilâyet). I used find and replace with the following regular expressions to create these tab-delineated lines:\nreplace $ with # (to remove all line breaks) delete ##[0-9]* (to remove page numbers) replace [[:::CharHeight=11::]] with \\n\u0026amp; (to create a line break between each \u0026ldquo;new alphabet\u0026rdquo; administrative unit name, which are all given in 11pt font). replace [[:::CharHeight=12::]] with \\t\u0026amp;\\t (to create tabs before and after every \u0026ldquo;old alphabet\u0026rdquo; administrative unit name, which are given in 12 point foint). For some reason these find and replace operations took forever in Libreoffice. When I broke the document into 8,000 word chunks, it went a lot faster. I pasted the results into a spreadsheet and cleaned up a few errors manually. There were about 6400 records in the table that resulted, which is archived as Ottgaz-data-1.\n2. Creating columns The next step was to produce a single line for each place listed, with every associated unit class/district (unvan/bağlı) pair broken out. I used OpenRefine to parse the columns before and after the unvan names, which were quite standard and limited in number. Almost half of the units are associated with only one class/district pair, which is to say they were only located under one date. At the other extreme, Kozan has 14 (!) pairs, which is to say that (according to Sezen) its administrative status changed 14 times over the history of the Ottoman Empire. It took a bit more than a day to do this. This version is archived as Ottgaz-data-2.\n3. Breaking districts into multiple columns Next I broke concatenated district entries (for example, İstefan→Sinop→Kastamonu→Kastamonu vilâyeti) into discrete ordered columns. This version (I think) is archived as Ottgaz-data-3.\n4. Cleaning and standardizing I then used OpenRefine to format and clean the data. This was a laborious process, and went through several iterations. I\u0026rsquo;ve archived all of these iterations as .tsv files and as OpenRefine projects, though I expect that they will be of little interest or use to anyone. This fourth iteration contains all of the bağlı hierarchical names in a single column, which is to say that it does not have a single row for each placename. It contains 38,465 rows. I used this method to standardize expressions of placenames and dates using OpenRefine\u0026rsquo;s clustering tools. This version, comprising 885 edits, is archived as Ottgaz-data-4.\n5. Restructuring column hierarchy The fifth iteration contains only one line for every place, and begins to elaborate the hierarchical structure. It stretches to 80 columns. I standardized the bağlı hierarchical language (which contained a lot of errors, some of which remain no doubt). I have given each nesting bağlı place name its own column, so, for example, İstefan→Sinop→Kastamonu→Kastamonu vilâyeti becomes 4 columns. These are numbered in hierarchical sequence: \u0026ldquo;Bağlı 1 1\u0026rdquo; is the smallest district containing the place in question (İstefan in this example), and Bağlı 2 etc are larger units. I have also broken out dates into their own columns, and standardized the titles (unvanlar), which will form part of the ontology of the gazetteer. Finally, I have amalgamated \u0026ldquo;unvan\u0026rdquo; notes and \u0026ldquo;bağlı\u0026rdquo; notes (anything other than a district type or a placename) into a single \u0026ldquo;notes\u0026rdquo; column. This version, comprising 873 edits, is archived as Ottgaz-data-5.\n6. Translation of headings The sixth iteration converts the headings into English, and continues the cleaning and standardization. I reversed the numbering of the containing units, so now Belongs_to_1-1 designates the largest unit. This version, comprising 454 edits, is archived as Ottgaz-data-6.\n7. Introduction of database elements The seventh iteration begins to implement some internal references, by adding a field for ID numbers, and beginning to reference IDs in the hierarchy. It also adds a Place_type field, differentiating between cities and regions, and an Ott_or_not field, a boolean category to isolate those records which situate the place in a hierarchy entirely outside of modern Turkey. This version, comprising 818 edits, is archived as Ottgaz-data-7.\n8. Reconciliation and RDF skeleton The eighth iteration, which I\u0026rsquo;m working on now, should be the last produced in OpenRefine. It integrates wikidata, geonames, and periodo references and contains an RDF skeleton. This version will be archived as Ottgaz-data-8.\nRough plans: I will combine rows which refer to the same place (many places are listed twice, under different names). I will give each administrative unit a number I will align the dates with a periodization of sultan\u0026rsquo;s epochs that I created on PerioDo. I will substitute the appropriate number for each \u0026ldquo;containing district\u0026rdquo; (bağlı olduğu\u0026hellip;) field I will produce an RDF skeleton and export the data, conforming to the Pelagios Gazetteer Interchange Format I will wrangle this onto the [ottgaz.org] server, using OntoWiki at least initially ","permalink":"https://willhanley.net/blog/2017-10-06-transforming-oya/","tags":["ottgaz","ocr","openrefine","sezen","archived"],"title":"Transforming the Osmanlı Yer Adları"},{"categories":["Opinion"],"contents":"A century and a decade ago, an Istanbul court sentenced a Belgian named Edouard Joris to death for his part in a bomb attack on the Ottoman sultan. Joris was involved with two of the terrorisms of the turn of the century: anarchism and Armenian nationalism. The young man had moved from Antwerp to Istanbul in 1901. He found a job at the Singer sewing machine factory and struck up a friendship with the man at the next workbench, an Armenian. Joris accompanied this friend to meetings of the activist cell planning the attack and facilitated their preparations in various ways. Crucially, he placed an order for a custom-made carriage, fashioned with a cavity large enough to hold an explosive “infernal machine.”\nOn July 21, 1905, the conspirators parked the carriage along the route of Sultan Abdulhamid II\u0026rsquo;s weekly procession from the Yildiz palace. Fitted with a timer, it was set to explode as the sultan passed. As luck would have it, on this day the sultan paused on his path and avoided the blast. Twenty-six others were killed and many more injured. Most of the Armenian conspirators fled the country immediately. Joris, a naive personality, remained in Istanbul; he did not understand the Armenian language and may have been excluded from the escape plan. The Ottoman police picked him up a week later, tracking him down using the delivery ledger of the carriage merchant. He was tried and sentenced to death.\nThe Joris affair is not well known, but it came up almost immediately after the 22 March bombings in Brussels, when an attempted meme about Joris surfaced on a Turkish site: “The Belgian killer who introduced Turks to terror; that same terror has returned to Belgium 100 years later.” Columnist Murat Bardakçı made the same connection. This crude “bomb here, bomb there” reminder does not yield much insight. The many parallels between anarchist terrorism at the turn of the twentieth century and Islamist terrorism at the turn of the twenty-first offer more food for thought. Today\u0026rsquo;s international movement seeking to overturn the world order through radically transgressive acts is not unprecedented. Starting in the 1880s, anarchist “propaganda of the deed” attacks took place in Europe, the US, and the Middle East. A series of studies comparing anarchist terrorism and Islamist terrorism has elucidated similarities and differences in anarchist and Islamist motives. There has been little comparison of the popular terror and state repression that the two movements elicited. It is nothing new that attacks in Brussels and Paris get more attention than attacks in Ankara, Baghdad, or Lahore. Despite work showing that the eastern Mediterranean was an important stage for anarchists, the division of terrorism into notable and forgotten spheres endures. Mike Davis\u0026rsquo; history of the car bomb, for example, traces its origins to a horse wagon on Wall Street in 1920, overlooking the Yildiz carriage of 1905. One way around this competition for attention is to compare the reaction of the Belgian and Turkish states to the Yildiz and the Brussels attacks.\nThis comparison reveals small states seeking to leverage terrorist events to bolster alliances and garner the support of great powers. For present-day Turkey and Belgium, the attacks offer a plethora of safe small steps in a bigger prestige contest. After the Brussels bombings, Turkish President Erdogan blamed Belgium\u0026rsquo;s intelligence failings. This was not ex post facto critique, however; it accorded with Turkish grousing days before the attack about Belgian tolerance for PKK protesters. Thanks to this “gotcha” moment, Turkey was able to cast itself as reliable, even respectable. The failings of Belgium\u0026rsquo;s embattled nation-state project have been blamed for its apparent vulnerability to terrorism, with pundits questioning the state’s trustworthiness as a military ally. But various parties in Belgium will doubtless seek to ride the coattails of global fear of terrorist attacks towards local power, and they will want the support of bigger fish than Benyamin Netanyahu.\nThe 1905 Joris affair also produced a series of Belgian and Ottoman performances pitched to a world audience. The conviction of Joris triggered a legal and diplomatic crisis between the two states, both of which tried (without great success) to engage the support of greater powers. Under a legal system called the capitulations, European residents of the Ottoman empires were exempt from many forms of Ottoman law and taxation. By the nineteenth century, this system, which emerged in the sixteenth century as unilateral privileges dispensed by the sultan to European subjects, took the form of unequal treaties in favor of European states. Minor powers such as Belgium, Brazil, and the United States signed their capitulations treaties with the Ottomans in the 1830s. But sizable (and poor) European migrant communities in Ottoman cities became a headache for consuls, and in the second half of the nineteenth century these foreign authorities turned the criminal prosecution of foreigners over to the Ottoman courts. The capitulations stipulated that sentences on foreigners were to be carried out by consular authorities, but after the 1870s even these sentences were typically executed by Ottoman authorities and foreign convicts were incarcerated in Ottoman prisons.\nOttoman authorities were unwilling to follow standard procedure and turn Joris over to Belgian authorities for execution of his sentence. First, the crime was attempted regicide, which was no ordinary crime, and Joris was an anarchist associated with Armenian “terrorists,” which made him no ordinary criminal. When Joris was sentenced to death by the Ottoman court, a second problem arose: Belgium (responsible for carrying out any Ottoman sentences against its own nationals) had abandoned capital punishment decades earlier. There were few Belgian subjects in the Ottoman empire, and neither government could point to much precedent. (American authorities wrestled with similar jurisdiction problems in the 1905 case of Charles Vartanian and Hovhanes Afarian, Armenian activists who were naturalized U.S. citizens.) Through 1906 and 1907, Joris languished in Ottoman prison in a sort of legal limbo.\nDiplomatic notes flew back and forth between the Belgian and Ottoman foreign ministries in the months after the trial, but there was no appreciable progress towards a settlement. The law school of Macquarie University has posted a compilation of coverage of this exchange as published in the Times of London. Meanwhile, two prominent lawyers argued the case in the pages of the Revue de droit international et de législation comparée. On the Ottoman side, foreign ministry lawyer (and future foreign minister) Gabriel Noradounghian (1852-1936) argued that both judgment and execution were central organs of territorial sovereignty, and these powers could never be transferred to another state. Albéric Rolin (1843-1937), secretary-general of the Institut du droit international, a body that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1904, advocated for the Belgian side. Whereas in 1894 Rolin had argued strongly in the pages of the Revue that anarchy was a crime “against all states, to be combated by all available means,” now he privileged compatriotism. He insisted that Belgium had extraterritorial rights over Joris under treaty and custom, suggesting that the only reason that the Ottomans refused to comply with Belgium’s request was because Belgium was a “petit pays” that could not threaten the Empire with force.\nThen and now, the threat of force is never far from extraterritorial claims. Although territorial jurisdiction is a leading principle of the modern international legal regime, it faces considerable pressures in the present moment. This pressure draws on the claim that terrorism warrants forceful response and the fact that only great powers possess the requisite force, in the form of invading armies, covert forces, drones, or “investigators,” to fight terrorism. Small states defend their territorial jurisdiction by claiming anti-terror competence.\nAs we have seen, the claim to competence can be developed on the back of other, less competent small states—especially non-European and non-Christian ones. This was equally true in the nineteenth century. The Belgian law on the organization and jurisdiction of consulates of 31 December 1851 stated that any Belgian charged with a crime in a non-Christian country must be tried in Belgium. Decades of Ottoman administrative and legal reforms aimed to obviate claims such as this—and the numerous nineteenth century territorial invasions that they occasioned. But even in 1906, thirty years after the secularized, codified Ottoman nizami legal reforms, a domestic Belgian legal journal could maintain European civilizational privilege: “We must note that the Turkish law is [only] the Qur’an, that the whole Oriental system of law is purely religious, and that, so long as this system remains as it is, the idea of ‘non-Christian countries’ will remain a necessary concept for all European peoples.”\nIf the direction of disdain is reversed today, with Belgium now cast in the role of the “sick man”, the dynamic of small state competition remains the same. Belgium\u0026rsquo;s territorial jurisdiction seems likely to be overrun by greater, more “competent” authorities. Europe\u0026rsquo;s move to further enforce its border controls may well extend to the borders and airports—classic sites of extraterritorial action—of states it deems insecure. Turkey has thus far avoided such encroachments (sometimes militarily), and will continue to ruthlessly extend its credentials of competency by combatting Da‘esh, Kurds, Gulenists, academics, Syrian refugees, and many others.\nIn these maneuvers, as in so much of international law, ordinary people disappear, subsumed in their nationality categories and overwhelmed by state actors. Edouard Joris was finally released in 1907, returning to a quiet life in Belgium. We know little about the other “conspirators” tried and convicted along with him. Then and now, the international threat of terrorism creates perverse incentives for small states to exercise harsh territorial sovereignty over their own nationals in order to curry the favor of big states and forestall their interventions.\nNote: this piece was originally published on Jadaliyya.

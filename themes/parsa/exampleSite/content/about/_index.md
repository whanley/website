I studied at the Universities of Saskatchewan, Toronto, Jordan, and Oxford before taking my doctorate at Princeton. My current research examines categories used to describe Middle Eastern societies.

I am working on a book about the emergence of nationality as a social and legal category in Alexandria (Egypt) between 1880 and 1914. My aim is to understand how and when ordinary people began to identify themselves as Egyptians, Ottomans, foreigners, and the like. This research is based on documents produced by the city's police and its European consular courts. I teach courses on Egypt, the Middle East, and legal history.

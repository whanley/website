I post my academic work, including downloadable PDFs, in [Zenodo's repositories](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=owners:%2020288&sort=-publication_date). It is also available via my [ORCID profile](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1832-6805). It is _not_ available on `academia.edu` (nor should yours be).

**Non-academic**

On the blog section of this site, I also post copies of non-academic pieces, such as op eds I've written for my local paper, the [Tallahassee Democrat](http://tallahassee.com). For better or worse, I also use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/HanleyWill).

I post my academic work, including downloadable PDFs, in [Zenodo's repositories](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=owners:%2020288&sort=-publication_date) or via my [ORCID profile](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1832-6805).

On this site, I also post copies of less academic pieces, such as op eds in my local paper, the [Tallahassee Democrat](http://tallahassee.com). For better or worse, I also use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/HanleyWill).

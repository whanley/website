I've undertaken a few standalone projects.

### Digital Egyptian Gazette

[dig-eg-gaz.github.io](http://dig-eg-gaz.github.io) is the product of an FSU class that I've taught five times. It presents the full contents of the Alexandria daily newspaper _The Egyptian Gazette_ for the years 1905-1908. It's work in progress. I wrote about the class for [Pedagogical Perspectives](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/text-encoding-innocents-meet-the-egyptian-gazette/54E6BEA6356D69D47DD5D0FF881FD577/share/a40afe86c6cc84d4eefa5cbf5d9bd32cc5d07a27) feature of the _Review on Middle East Studies_.

### International Law Corpus

[ilcorpus](https://ilcorpus.netlify.app/) offers some visualizations from my current work with international law publications from the 1860s to the 1930s.

### Ottoman Gazetteer

[ottgaz.org](http://ottgaz.org) presents some materials for an RDF database of the administrative geography of the Ottoman empire.

### Prosop

[Prosop: semantic shadows of persons past](https://web.archive.org/web/20190101134908/http://prosop.org/) [_retired_] was an NEH-funded project, 2011-4.

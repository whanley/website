I am a legal and social historian of the Middle East. I am associate professor of history at [Florida State University](https://history.fsu.edu/person/will-hanley). I studied at the Universities of [Saskatchewan](https://artsandscience.usask.ca/history/index.php), [Toronto](https://www.history.utoronto.ca/), and [Oxford](https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/research-centres/middle-east-centre) before taking my doctorate in history at [Princeton](https://history.princeton.edu/).

My first book, [Identifying with Nationality: Europeans, Ottomans, and Egyptians in Alexandria](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/identifying-with-nationality/9780231177627), was published by Columbia University Press in 2017. Find the rest of my scholarship, including downloadable PDFs, in [Zenodo's repositories](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=owners:%2020288&sort=-publication_date) or via my [ORCID profile](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1832-6805).

I am currently working on a Cairo-centered history of international law between 1870 and 1930.

I am also engaged in a variety of digital projects, which I describe elsewhere on this website.

My research has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Forum Transregionale Studien, the DAAD, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

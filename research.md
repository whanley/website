### Digital projects

* I am working on a [digital edition of the *Egyptian Gazette*](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io), a daily newspaper from turn-of-the-century Egypt.
* I am developing a digital humanities tool called [Prosop](http://prosop.org), for which I received an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant in 2011.
* I am working on an [Ottoman Gazetteer](http://ottgaz.org).
* I am completing a tutorial on [small RDF databases](http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/making-a-small-rdf-database) for the [_Programming Historian_](http://programminghistorian.org/).
